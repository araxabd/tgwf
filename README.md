# TGWF : Token Generator Without [any] Framework (Except for Django)

we didn't need(necessary) to any framework for generate a token for authentication in django (but we can use to be better)

## What we need to install ?
you just can make a virtualenv and activate that .
then install django with `$ pip install django` .
now you can run and use that with `$ python manage.py runserver` (in proj directroy).
or you can copy this for your own project.

#### TODO:
- [ ] add register (view and urls)
- [ ] beautification on admin panel
- [ ] better performance
